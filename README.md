# gleague-nba
The goal behind the work within this repository is to give NBA front offices and basketball analysts the ability to identify the best and worst NBA comparisons for G League players.

Included within this repository are a few files: 

* An R file that contains our functions and all the preprocessing necessary for the functions
* An R file that contains everything else used for our analysis
* Our written report that outlines all steps taken that will allow anyone to replicate our project - beginning from data collection and sources all the way to creation of the functions themselves
